# Deploy to the Windows store

Because Crosswalk for Windows is a C++ application and not a [Microsoft universal app](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn894631.aspx) we do not support deploying on the Windows store. However Microsoft did announce that they will allow deploying Win32 applications on the Windows 10 store through [“Project Centennial”](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/bridges). When the support is released we will evaluate the possibility to create Crosswalk applications that can be deployed on the Windows Store.
