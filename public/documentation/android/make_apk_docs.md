# Using make_apk.py

As of Crosswalk version 16, make_apk.py is deprecated and will be removed from future builds. The new, simpler, NPM-based [crosswalk-app-tools](system_setup.html) is recommended for building and debugging. For legacy support, the documentation for make_apk is still available from the following links.

* Host setup for [Windows](windows_host_setup_make_apk.html) and [Linux](linux_host_setup_make_apk.html) desktops
* [Build an application](build_an_application_make_apk.html)
* [Android target setup](android_target_setup.html) (Same for new tools)
* [Run on Android](run_on_android_make_apk.html)
* [Remote debugging](android_remote_debugging_make_apk.html)
