# Hello World sample

<img class='sample-thumb' src='/assets/sampapp-icon-helloworld.png'>

The smallest of applications -- Hello, World! This sample provides a manifest.json
and a minimal set of HTML files to start an application from the ground up.

This application is part of the
[Crosswalk samples](https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk-samples).

The steps for setting up an environment for Crosswalk are explained
in detail in the [Getting started](/documentation/getting_started.html)
tutorial.

## Hello World on Android

Once you have set up the Crosswalk Android packaging dependencies,
follow the steps in [Run on Android](/documentation/android/run_on_android.html).

The quick version is that you can build the Hello World apk with:

```cmdline
> <crosswalk-app-tools>/src/crosswalk-pkg --crosswalk=<crosswalk version> \
    --platforms=android <path to crosswalk-samples>/hello-world
```

`<crosswalk-app-tools>` refers to the directory where you downloaded crosswalk-app-tools.

Then install the apk file on Android:

```cmdline
> adb install org.xwalk.helloworld*.apk
```
