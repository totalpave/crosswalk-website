# Intel App Security API

The new [IntelÂ® App Security API](https://software.intel.com/en-us/app-security-api/api) is a collection of JavaScript APIs for HTML5 application developers. It enables all web developers, even those who are not security experts, to take advantage of the security properties and capabilities supported by the platform.

The security API is now available as a Crosswalk extension.
 
## Security features made simple
The new web API gives developers the tools to confidently do the following:

* secure data (data-in-use)
* secure storage (data-at-rest)
* secure transport (data-in-move)

Effectively securing your application data is often a complex task.  Now, with a few, straightforward calls, you can protect connection tokens from man-in-the-cloud attacks, secure cached data on the device, and use secure network connections to your backend.

You don't need to be a cryptography expert, and you don't need to create and manage encryption keys. The available security protections are configured automatically for you, on demand, and per your need.
 
## Documentation
In the documentation you can find APIs description, including parameters details, error report details and sample code.  You can also find frequently asked questions and code snippets that you can copy and paste into your application.
