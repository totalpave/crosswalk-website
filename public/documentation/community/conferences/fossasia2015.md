#### Crosswalk Workshop Abstract ####
<p>HTML5 has been adopted by many developers for its advantages such as straight-forward integration with cloud services, flexible layout
with responsive design, and cutting edge technologies such as WebRTC, WebGL, and Canvas. </p>

<p>However, using the latest web standards has been challenging on Android because the ecosystem
is heterogeneous and fragmented with various versions in use.  Deploying on popular but dated Android versions such as 4.0 is often
complicated, as the integrated WebView may have performance limitations and is lacking important features. Application authors are
then restricted to the smallest common featureset.</p>

<p>With <b>the Crosswalk Project</b>, a Chromium-based HTML5 framework developed by Intel, those
limitations can be overcome. Crosswalk offers you a way to bundle the Chromium web engine with your app and deploy it across all
Android 4.x versions. On top of solving portability issues, Crosswalk adds features (SysApps and Presentation API, SIMD, Manifest
support) and optimizations for web app developers.</p>

<p>During this presentation we will demonstrate how easy it is to package and deploy your application on Android and how well existing tools such as Cordova works with Crosswalk. Come and find out how your HTML5 applications can run better than ever on Android! </b>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
