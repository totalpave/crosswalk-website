<p>The Crosswalk plugin will be part of the PhoneGap 5.0 and build service!  This will give developers the ability to easily use Crosswalk as their runtime for Android applications while building with the PhoneGap tools they know and love. In addition, with the introduction in [Cordova Android 4.0.0](http://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2015/04/15/cordova-android-4.0.0.html) of pluggable WebView support, it is now easy to use the Crosswalk WebView with your Cordova app.  See [Using Crosswalk WebView in Cordova Android 4.0](/documentation/cordova/crosswalk_with_cordova4.html).</p>
