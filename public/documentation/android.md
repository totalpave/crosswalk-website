# Crosswalk Project for Android

This section describes how to create web and hybrid applications using the Crosswalk Project for the [Android operating system](http://developer.android.com/index.html).

<strong>Note: For Cordova users</strong>, follow the tutorial in [Crosswalk WebView in Cordova 4.0](/documentation/cordova.html) to easily use the advanced Crosswalk webview with your Cordova 4.0 app.

**This tutorial explains how to:**

1.  [Set up your development system *host*](/documentation/android/system_setup.html): the machine where you will be developing the application. Windows and Linux are officially supported.

2.  Set up your [Android target](/documentation/android/android_target_setup.html): the device that will run the Crosswalk application, either physical or virtual.

3.  [Build a very simple HTML5 application](/documentation/android/build_an_application.html).

4.  [Run your application](/documentation/android/run_on_android.html) using the a stable release of Crosswalk

5.  [Deploy the application to the Android app store](/documentation/android/deploy_to_android_store.html)

You will need to be comfortable using a command line to follow these steps. If you prefer to use a graphical integrated development environment (IDE), the free **Intel XDK** provides an alternative way to package applications for Crosswalk Android. See the [Intel XDK website](http://xdk-software.intel.com/) for more details.

In the documentation, commands you should run in a shell are prefixed with a `>` character. On Windows, you can use the standard Windows console; on Linux, you can use a bash shell.

**By the end of the tutorial**, you should understand the workflow for creating Crosswalk applications from your own HTML5 projects.

**This tutorial does not cover:**

*   How to write HTML5 applications. We use a simple HTML5 application for this tutorial, so we can focus on the packaging and deployment aspects of Crosswalk.
*   How to use [Crosswalk-specific APIs](/documentation/apis/web_apis.html#Experimental-APIs). The code in the tutorial should run on any modern web browser, as well as on Crosswalk.
*   How to compile Crosswalk itself. This is covered in the [Contribute](/contribute) section.
