# Using Crosswalk Lite

Building your application with Crosswalk Lite, or "Lite", is the same as the normal Crosswalk build.  For details on setting up your development system, see the [Getting Started page](/documentation/getting_started.html).  The NPM-based `crosswalk-app-tools` is the packaging tool for creating Crosswalk applications. For details on the tool, refer to [Usage of crosswalk-app-tools](/documentation/crosswalk-app-tools.html).

## Build with Lite
To build your application with Lite, add the `--android="lite"` parameter to the packaging command:
```cmdline
$ crosswalk-pkg --android="lite" <your webapp path>
```

`crosswalk-pkg` will download the Lite engine and create an APK of your application.


### Download Crosswalk-Lite Manually
Alternatively, you can manually download the Lite engine from the [build directory](https://download.01.org/crosswalk/releases/crosswalk-lite/android/canary/latest/) onto your local machine and then run:

```cmdline
$ crosswalk-pkg --android="lite" \
                --crosswalk=<downloads path>/crosswalk-17.46.455.1.zip \
				<your webapp path> 
```

Additional build versions can be found in the [build output directory](https://download.01.org/crosswalk/releases/crosswalk-lite/android/canary/)

Lite can only be bundled with your application in the standard "embedded mode" where the Lite library is added to your APK. [Shared mode](/documentation/shared_mode.html) is not supported.

## Embedding Lite webview

Developers can embed the Lite webview in their Java-based Android projects just as they could with Crosswalk. For details on embedding, see [Embedding the Crosswalk Project](https://crosswalk-project.org/documentation/android/embedding_crosswalk.html) and [Developing with Crosswalk AAR](https://crosswalk-project.org/documentation/android/embedding_crosswalk/crosswalk_aar.html). One difference with Lite is `onXWalkReady()`, described [below](#onXwalkReady).

Starting with Lite v17, we added the maven server for Lite. We now have 2 separate maven URLs for Crosswalk and Crosswalk Lite. Make sure the maven URL in your project is for Crosswalk Lite instead of Crosswalk.

* Crosswalk: https://download.01.org/crosswalk/releases/crosswalk/android/maven2/ 
* Crosswalk Lite: https://download.01.org/crosswalk/releases/crosswalk-lite/android/maven2/

The latest Lite release build can be found in:<br/>

### <a class="doc-anchor" id="onXwalkReady"></a>New API: `org.xwalk.core.XWalkActivity.onXWalkReady()`

The `onXwalkReady` API was introduced to check whether the Crosswalk environment is available to use. The Crosswalk environment is not available under two scenarios:

* Shared mode: Need download from app store like Google Play
* Crosswalk-Lite: `libxwalkcore.so` is compressed with LZMA and needs to be decompressed first.

The following changes are needed:

* `XWalkView` initialization code moved from `onCreate()` to `onXWalkReady()`.
* `Activity` should inherit from `org.xwalk.core.XWalkActivity` instead of `android.app.Activity`.
* In `AndroidManifest.xml`, `android:name` should change to `org.xwalk.core.XWalkApplication`.

```
import org.xwalk.core.XWalkActivity;
import org.xwalk.core.XWalkResourceClient;
import org.xwalk.core.XWalkUIClient;
import org.xwalk.core.XWalkView;

public class MainActivity extends XWalkActivity {
    XWalkView mXWalkView;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        //Don't initXWalkView here!
    }

    public void initXWalkView() {
        mXWalkView = new XWalkView(this);
        RelativeLayout Ll = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.layout1);
        Ll.addView(mXWalkView);

        mXWalkView.setUIClient(new XWalkUIClient(mXWalkView));
        mXWalkView.setResourceClient(new XWalkResourceClient(mXWalkView));
    
        mXWalkView.load("http:///xxxx/test.html", null);
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onXWalkReady() {
        //initXWalkView in onXWalkReady().
        initXWalkView();
    }
}
```

## Running a Lite Application

The first time an application runs that has been built with Lite, `libxwalkcore.so` must be decompressed. The following dialog is displayed for a couple of seconds:
  <img src='/assets/crosswalk-lite-uncompress-dialog.png' style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 50%"/>
This is only displayed the first time.
