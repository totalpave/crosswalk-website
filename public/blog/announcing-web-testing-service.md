We are pleased to announce our Web Testing Service today.

The [Web Testing Service](http://wts.crosswalk-project.org/) is a web-based test runner. It indicates how well browsers or web runtimes support web standards and related specifications on different platforms.

The Web Testing Service is a collection of test suites for the latest W3C web standards and for the latest cutting-edge web technologies that are not yet a part of W3C, e.g. SIMD.

By using Web Testing Service, your product can be evaluated against the latest and comprehensive web standards support, and the results can also be compared with other web products you care about.

You are encouraged to play with the service, as always we'd like to get your feedback. Any suggestions and contributions to [Web Testing Service source code](https://github.com/crosswalk-project/web-testing-service/) are welcome.
