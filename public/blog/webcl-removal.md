[WebCL](https://www.khronos.org/webcl/) is an API that defines JavaScript bindings to the Khronos OpenCL standard for heterogeneous parallel computing. It has been part of Crosswalk as an experimental feature since version 14.

Given the fact that there arenâ€™t any current plans to implement it in any of the major browsers, and that we are unaware of anyone actively using it with Crosswalk, we have decided that the non-trivial effort required to maintain it is no longer justified, and that it will be removed starting with Crosswalk 22. We encourage users interested in parallel execution of their code to look at [SIMD.JS](http://tc39.github.io/ecmascript_simd/), [WASM](https://crosswalk-project.org/documentation/tutorials/webassembly.html) and [Web Workers](https://www.w3.org/TR/workers/).
