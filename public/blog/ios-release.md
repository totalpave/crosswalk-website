We recognize that iOS is one of the most popular mobile platforms and we have been hard at work to enable developers to create one web application (HTML+Javascript+CSS) that can leverage the Crosswalk API and run on both Android and iOS. Today we are happy to present the 1.0 release of Crosswalk Project for iOS*.  

In the 1.0 release, the following highlight features are included:

* Object-Mapping based extension framework. This enables a developer to write their own, separate Web API in an easier way. You can simply write your extension in Objective-C/Swift and define the interfaces to be exposed to JavaScript, then the JavaScript stub codes will be generated at runtime.
* Full official Cordova 4.0.0 plugin support.
* Unified Crosswalk packaging tool support (iOS backend of crosswalk-app-tool is provided) 
* [Presentation API](/documentation/apis/presentation_api_tutorial.html)

Note:  Crosswalk Project for iOS supports iOS 8 and newer.  It leverages the WkWebView which bring lots of HTML5 features and performance benefits over the older UIWebView. Apple's official iOS 8 adoption is over 82%.
