We are pleased to announce the first version of [Crosswalk Project for Linux](/documentation/linux.html), a runtime for modern web applications on Debian based Linux desktop distributions.

Crosswalk Project for Linux is based on the Chromium content layer and supports cutting-edge web technologies like WebGL, WebRTC, WebAudio, ServiceWorker, SIMD, and Web Manifest.

The JavaScript API extension mechanism is also supported, allowing for developers to extend web application capabilities and bridge native code with their JavaScript code to make competitive hybrid Linux desktop applications.

Finally, Crosswalk Project for Linux provides tools for developers to package their applications into Debian packages. Web applications with standard W3C web app manifests can easily be packaged one command line. See the [documentation](/documentation/linux.html) for instructions.

The Crosswalk Project Debian package is available from the [canary channel](https://download.01.org/crosswalk/releases/crosswalk/linux/deb/canary/), and has been tested on Ubuntu Linux 14.04 64-bit and Deepin Linux 2014.2.

We look forward to hearing your feedback!
