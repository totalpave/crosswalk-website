A few months ago, [security issues](http://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2014/08/04/android-351.html) were discovered in the Android platform of Cordova 3.5.0. Because Crosswalk includes this version since release 7, if you have published a Crosswalk application you may have received a warning about this in your Google developer console.

The issues were fixed in Cordova 3.5.1, and we have updated our current stable release (Crosswalk 8) with this version. We have also updated the previous stable release, Crosswalk 7. The same is in progress for Crosswalk 9 Beta and will be completed before this release enters the stable channel. 

If your application uses any of these versions, you should update to the latest version of Crosswalk stable and upload it to the store. You can download the Crosswalk releases from the links below:
