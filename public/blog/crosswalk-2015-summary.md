Crosswalk had an incredible 2015, growing in adoption, features, and integration. Here's raising a glass to what was accomplished and to our great community of web developers who made Crosswalk the best runtime for mobile web apps on Android.

### New features
A lot of significant new features were implemented in 2015.

* [64-bit support](/blog/android-64bit.html): 64-bit builds of the Crosswalk runtime enabling the best performance of application running on 64-bit Android devices.
* [Shared mode](/blog/crosswalk-shared-mode.html): The ability to package Android web applications in "shared mode" to allow the runtime to be dynamically downloaded, reducing APK size and solving architecture incompatiblity problems.
* [Crosswalk Lite](https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk-website/wiki/Crosswalk-Project-Lite): Initiated research to reduce the runtime footprint by removing features. Reduced APK size from 20M to 10M
* [Crosswalk-App-Tools](/blog/crosswalk-app-tools-alpha.html): A new, Node.js-based build tool, replacing make_apk.py and unifying the setup and building process across all platforms.
* [Game mode](/blog/crosswalk-game-mode.html): Working with Cocos2D, the team greatly optimized HTML5 games, especially complex scenarios, stunning effects, and advanced features.
* 6 new releases. From [Crosswalk version 11, with Chromium 40](/blog/crosswalk-11-beta.html) to [Crosswalk version 16, with Chromium 45](/blog/crosswalk-16.html).

### New supported platforms
Android and Tizen were the only supported platforms at the start of the year. Only a year later, all major platforms are supported at some level.  This means less work for the developer and broader reach for each web application built using Crosswalk.

* [iOS mobile](/blog/ios-release.html): Crosswalk Project for iOS 8 and newer, leveraging WkWebView to enable web apps to leverage the Crosswalk API.
* [Linux / Debian desktop](/blog/announce-linux-dt.html): Release of the first version of Crosswalk Project for Linux (Debian), and adoption by [Deepin](http://blog.deepin.org/2015/12/crosswalk-project-for-deepin-released/?language=en) as their default web runtime.
* [Windows desktop](/blog/crosswalk-windows.html):  Easily port your web application to run on Windows desktop. Includes creation of an MSI installer.

### Integration into new developer tools
As the Crosswalk Project grew in use and popularity, more tool creators recognized the value of enabling Crosswalk in their IDEs and backends.

* [Cordova / Phonegap](/blog/using-custom-crosswalk-in-cordova-plugin.html): Cordova CLI 5 introduced cordova-crosswalk-webview-plugin, making replacing the default runtime with Crosswalk easy.
* [Telerik, Trigger.io, Manifold.js](/documentation/community/tools.html): Many new tools added support for using Crosswalk for their developers.

### Community and Awards
* [Conferences](/documentation/community/conferences.html): Crosswalk engineers and architects presented at over a dozen major Android and web development conferences in 2015.
* [Outstanding open source project](/blog/copu2015-award.html): The Crosswalk Project was awarded Outstanding Open Source Project by the China Open Source Promotion Union (COPU) at its annual World Summit.
